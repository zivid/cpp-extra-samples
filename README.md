# cpp-extra-samples

This repository contains additional **C++** code samples for **Zivid**.

[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-url]

The basic samples are available at [https://www.zivid.com/downloads](https://www.zivid.com/downloads).
The Windows Zivid installer adds these samples in C:\Users\Public\Documents\Zivid\samples and they should build out of the box using Visual Studio 2015 or 2017.
Check out our [tutorial on configuring and building these samples on Ubuntu](https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/59441336/Configure+C+Samples+with+CMake+and+then+build+them+using+make+in+Ubuntu).

## Instructions

[**Install Zivid Software**](https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/59080712/Zivid+Software+Installation).
Note: The version tested with Zivid cameras is 1.5.0.

#### Windows

Launch the Command Prompt by pressing *Win + R* keys on the keyboard, then type cmd and press Enter.

Navigage to a location where you want to clone the repository, then run to following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/zivid/cpp-extra-samples
```
[comment]: <> (Choose a sample solution and configure it with CMake.)
[comment]: <> (Launch Visual Studio, open, build, and run the sample solution.)

Configure the sample solution with CMake, open it in Visual Studio, build it, run it. If you are uncertain about doing this, check out our tutorial for configuring [**C++ Extra Samples**](https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/61472793/Configure+C+Extra+Samples+with+CMake+and+build+them+using+Visual+Studio+in+Windows) with CMake and building them using Visual Studio in Windows.

#### Ubuntu

Open the Terminal by pressing *Ctrl + Alt + T* keys on the keyboard.

Navigate to a location where you want to clone the repository, then run to following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/zivid/cpp-extra-samples
cd cpp-extra-samples
```

Build the project:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <options, see below> ..
make -j
```

Some of the samples depend on external libraries, in particular Eigen 3, OpenCV or PCL. If you don't want to install those, you can disable the samples depending on them by passing the following options, respectively, to `cmake`: `-DUSE_EIGEN3=OFF`, `-DUSE_OPENCV=OFF`, `-DUSEPCL=OFF`.

If you do want to use them:
- **Eigen 3**: Set `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=<path>` where `<path>` is the root directory of your Eigen3 installation (the folder containing Eigen/Core, Eigen/Dense etc.)
- **PCL** and **OpenCV**: If a recent enough version is installed on your system, these should just work. If not, set `-DPCL_DIR=<path>` / `-DOpenCV_DIR=<path>` where `<path>` is the directory containing `PCLConfig.cmake` and `OpenCVConfig.cmake`, respectively.

Note that some of the samples depend on the Zivid Cloud Visualizer.

The samples can now be run from the `build` directory, for instance like this:
```
./ZDF2PLY
```
